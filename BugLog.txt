Bugs:
    Player Sprite gets caught in walls when jumping towards them:
      - Fixed: Changed different player animations to more consistent collision masks
    Pigs get stuck on ledges when checking for falling
      - Fixed: Used invisible walls for pigs to detect if they're going to go over
        a ledge
    Regular Pig Charges, and then keeps following the player during the charge
      - Fixed: Changed pigs to only get charge direction only when player is detected
    Flame Projectiles from fire pigs float instead of travelling in parabola
      - Fixed: Only set ySpeed value in Create Event of obj_FlameProjectile
        instead of Step Event
    Pigs sometimes get caught on flat platform
      - Fixed: Adjusted Collision check to check several pixels above y-collision
        mask to accommodate sprites
    Regular Pig Charges occur randomly, without visual jump notification
      - Fixed: Added and extra boolean check to determine if pigs have done
        visual jump and chargeTimer has been reset
    Fire Pig changes direction before reaching a horizontal Collision
      - Fixed: Changed Ground tiles collision box to include whole square
    When Restarting Room, Game Crashes
      - Fixed: Life Bars only display if instances of obj_Life exist, if they
        don't, but hp > 0, then it creates instances equal to the amount of hp
